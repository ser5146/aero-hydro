This airfoil was provided by the author in a .wpa file which can be read by xflr5. xflr5 is an open source analysis tool for airfoils and 3D wings designed in the program using designated airfoils. Lifting Line Theory, Vortex Lattice Method, and a 3D panel Method are analysis options within xflr5."
